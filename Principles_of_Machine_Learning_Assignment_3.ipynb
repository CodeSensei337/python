        "An attempt at explaining the potentially confusing use of the term 'sample' in the field of audio processing is made herein as follows: Dataframe files are invariably reffered to in machine learning terms as 'samples', i.e. every row is a sample. However, audio files in themselves have a property referred to as 'sample', or more appropriately 'sample rate', which refers to the number of times the continuous sinusoidal sound wave is _accessed_ and _assessed_ (captured, recorded, snap-shot taken, digitally recorded, etc) in a series of discrete values. Basic information on this distinction is obtained from, among other sources, https://techterms.com/definition/sampling, https://techterms.com/definition/sample_rate, https://www.vocitec.com/docs-tools/blog/sampling-rates-sample-depths-and-bit-rates-basic-audio-concepts, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing). Sampling rate (or sampling frequency) is measured in Hertz (Hz) which is the number of samples taken in 1 second.<br>  \n"

        "Music has 3 primary elements: melody, harmony, and rhythm. Lyrics constitute a 4th element when there is singing. Melody and harmony, which work in tandem but are distinct from one another, are based on the arrangement of pitches.<br> \n",
        "\n",
        "A melody is a collection of musical tones that are grouped together as a single entity$^1$. Most compositions consist of multiple melodies working in conjunction with one another. A melody has 2 primary components - pitch and duration. Pitch is the actual audio vibration produced by an instrument, voice, hum, whistle or other expression of the music$^2$. It is basically the frequecy of the sound wave. Duration is the time that each pitch lasts and is divided into lengths of whole notes, half notes, quarter-note triplets, etc.<br> \n",
        "\n",
        "A harmony is the result of amalgamation of musical notes to form a cohesive whole$^3$. It is typically analysed as a series of chords. Harmonies are referred to as the vertical aspect of music as opposed to melodies which are referred to as horizontal$^4$. Although harmonies are simultaneously occurring frequencies, pitches, tones, notes, or chords, both melodic and harmonic outputs can be decomposed into consituent pitches, frequencies, power, and other properties of music. It is these properties that would be utilised to classify the dataset into melodies and harmonies."
